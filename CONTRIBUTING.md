# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN PIPELINE ? 

General guidelines can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) in the GitHub documentation. 

## Reproduce a pipeline ‚å®Ô∏è

:thinking: Not sure which one to start with ?  You can have a look on [this table](docs/pipeline_status.md) giving the status of the work on each pipeline. This will help choosing the one that best suits you !

### If you have experience with NiPype

We created a template with modifications to make and holes to fill to create a pipeline. You can find it on `narps_open/pipelines/pipeline_template.py`. 
If you feel it could be better explained, do not hesitate to modify the template or to create an issue about it.

### If you have experience with the original software package but not with NiPype

A fantastic tool named [Giraffe](https://giraffe.tools/porcupine/TimVanMourik/GiraffePlayground/master) is available. It allows you to create a graph of your pipeline using NiPype functions but without coding! Just save you NiPype script in a .py file and send it to us in a new issue, we will convert this script to a script which works with our specific parameters. 

## Find or propose an issue üìã

Issues are very important for this project. If you want to contribute, you can either **comment an existing issue** or **proposing a new issue**.

  - When opening a **Feature request**, you aim at improving the project with your ideas
  - If you encounter a problem or if there is a bug, please open a **Bug report** issue
  - Whenever you want, you can open a **Classic issue** to ask question, give feedbacks...

Some issues are (probably) already open, **don't hesitate to take a look at them.** Maybe your issue was already reported and in that case you may want to add details or other circumstances in which a problem appear.
